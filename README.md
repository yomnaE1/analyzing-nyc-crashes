# Abstract

The "Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes" dataset includes details about crash events that have occured in New York city since 2012. The dataset is updated weekly and contains information about the crash date, crash time, zipcode, latitude, longitude, street names of each crash. Additionally, the dataset includes details such as the number of pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists who have been injured, contributing factors of each veichle causing the crash, and the types of veichles causing the crash. This dataset is important because it can help state government agencies, researchers, and transportation planners develop strategies to help improve traffic safety in other large cities in the US. Additionally, this dataset can be useful for veichle manufacturers who can update a veichle's safety features based on the types of crashes and veichles most involved in the crashes.

# **Project Goals**

 The goal of this project is to analyze the causes of crahses in New York City, and based on that analysis build three machine learning models, to accurately predict the number of persons killed in New York City, which will provide insights for future city planners that could help improve traffic safety in other large cities, to prevent these deaths.

 We aim to achieve this goal by performing the following steps:

 * Data Collection
 * Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 * Data Visulaization
 * Exploratory Data Analysis
 * Machine Learning Models
